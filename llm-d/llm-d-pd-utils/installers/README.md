# NIXL Installation

1) Install NIXL and its dependencies:
   
If you are unsure of the existing installation, force install all components, as the below install script takes care of the dependencies (specific versions that are tested):
```bash
install_nixl.sh --force
```

2) Setup the PATH for the binaries and libraries:

```bash
source setup_path.sh
 ```

This can be added to ~/.bashrc
