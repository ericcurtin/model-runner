# KVCache Manager

## Overview

The KVCache-Manager is designed to connect high-level serving-stack goals with concrete system capabilities 
through a layered objective structure:

- **Improve user experience** 
  - By reducing Time-To-First-Token (TTFT)
     - Enabled through higher KVCache hit rates and reduced tensor transfers
     - Supported by smart routing and distributed cache availability
     - Optimized by proactive pre-placement of hot caches and session duplication/migration
- **Reduce serving costs**
  - By improving compute utilization
     - Minimize re-compute via KVCache reuse and locality-aware request handling
     - Leverage zero-copy cache transfers across nodes
- **Enable system scalability**
   - Through a distributed KVCache pool
      - Allows cache offloading and reuse across multiple serving instances
   - User session duplication/migration for true and seamless load balancing


## Vision 

This goal structure above is shaped by our vision for emerging use cases like RAG and agentic workflows, 
which involve heavy context-reuse across sessions and instances. 
Shared documents, tool prompts, and workflow steps create overlapping token streams that benefit significantly from 
cross-instance KVCache coordination. 

To implement this vision, the KVCache-Manager incorporates proactive cache placement, session duplication, 
and cluster-level cache APIs - bridging gaps in current serving stacks where KVCache management and utilization is 
not yet treated as a first-class concern.
