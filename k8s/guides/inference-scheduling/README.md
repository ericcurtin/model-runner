# Well-lit Path: Intelligent Inference Scheduling

## Overview

This guide deploys the recommended out of the box [scheduling configuration](https://github.com/vllm-k8s/vllm-k8s-inference-scheduler/blob/main/docs/architecture.md) for most vLLM deployments, reducing tail latency and increasing throughput through load-aware and prefix-cache aware balancing. This can be run on a single GPU that can load [Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B).

This profile defaults to the approximate prefix cache aware scorer, which only observes request traffic to predict prefix cache locality. The [precise prefix cache aware routing feature](../precise-prefix-cache-aware) improves hit rate by introspecting the vLLM instances for cache entries and will become the default in a future release.

## Hardware Requirements

This example out of the box requires 2 Nvidia GPUs of any kind (support determined by the inferencing image used).

## Prerequisites

- Have the [proper client tools installed on your local system](../prereq/client-setup/README.md) to use this guide.
- Ensure your cluster infrastructure is sufficient to [deploy high scale inference](../prereq/infrastructure)
- Configure and deploy your [Gateway control plane](../prereq/gateway-provider/README.md).
- [Create the `vllm-k8s-hf-token` secret in your target namespace with the key `HF_TOKEN` matching a valid HuggingFace token](../prereq/client-setup/README.md#huggingface-token) to pull models.
- Have the [Monitoring stack](../../docs/monitoring/README.md) installed on your system.

## Installation

Use the helmfile to compose and install the stack. The Namespace in which the stack will be deployed will be derived from the `${NAMESPACE}` environment variable. If you have not set this, it will default to `vllm-k8s-inference-scheduler` in this example.

```bash
export NAMESPACE=vllm-k8s-inference-scheduler # or any other namespace
cd guides/inference-scheduling
helmfile apply -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

**_NOTE:_** You can set the `$RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX` env variable to change the release names. This is how we support concurrent installs. Ex: `RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX=inference-scheduling-2 helmfile apply -n ${NAMESPACE}`

**_NOTE:_** This uses Istio as the default provider, see [Gateway Options](./README.md#gateway-options) for installing with a specific provider.

### Gateway and Hardware Options

#### Gateway Options

To see specify your gateway choice you can use the `-e <gateway option>` flag, ex:

```bash
helmfile apply -e kgateway -n ${NAMESPACE}
```


For DigitalOcean Kubernetes Service (DOKS):

```bash
helmfile apply -e digitalocean -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

**Note:** DigitalOcean deployment uses public Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B model (no HuggingFace token required) and is optimized for DOKS GPU nodes with automatic tolerations and node selectors. Gateway API v1 compatibility fixes are automatically included.

To see what gateway options are supported refer to our [gateway provider prereq doc](../prereq/gateway-provider/README.md#supported-providers). Gateway configurations per provider are tracked in the [gateway-configurations directory](../prereq/gateway-provider/common-configurations/).

You can also customize your gateway, for more information on how to do that see our [gateway customization docs](../../docs/customizing-your-gateway.md).

#### Hardware Backends

Currently in the `inference-scheduling` example we suppport configurations for `xpu`, `tpu` and `cuda` GPUs. By default we use modelserver values supporting `cuda` GPUs, but to deploy on one of the other speciality hardware backends you may use:

```bash
helmfile apply -e xpu  -n ${NAMESPACE} # targets istio as gateway provider with XPU hardware
# or
helmfile apply -e gke_tpu  -n ${NAMESPACE} # targets GKE externally managed as gateway provider with TPU hardware
```

### Install HTTPRoute

Follow provider specific instructions for installing HTTPRoute.

#### Install for "kgateway" or "istio"

```bash
kubectl apply -f httproute.yaml -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

#### Install for "gke"

```bash
kubectl apply -f httproute.gke.yaml -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

#### Install for "digitalocean"

```bash
kubectl apply -f httproute.yaml -n ${NAMESPACE}
```
## Verify the Installation

- Firstly, you should be able to list all helm releases to view the 3 charts got installed into your chosen namespace:

```bash
helm list -n ${NAMESPACE}
NAME                        NAMESPACE                 REVISION  UPDATED                               STATUS    CHART                     APP VERSION
gaie-inference-scheduling   vllm-k8s-inference-scheduler 1         2025-08-24 11:24:53.231918 -0700 PDT  deployed  inferencepool-v1.0.1      v1.0.1
infra-inference-scheduling  vllm-k8s-inference-scheduler 1         2025-08-24 11:24:49.551591 -0700 PDT  deployed  vllm-k8s-infra-v1.3.3        v0.3.0
ms-inference-scheduling     vllm-k8s-inference-scheduler 1         2025-08-24 11:24:58.360173 -0700 PDT  deployed  vllm-k8s-modelservice-v0.2.9 v0.2.0
```

- Out of the box with this example you should have the following resources:

```bash
kubectl get all -n ${NAMESPACE}

```

**_NOTE:_** This assumes no other guide deployments in your given `${NAMESPACE}` and you have not changed the default release names via the `${RELEASE_NAME}` environment variable.

## Using the stack

For instructions on getting started making inference requests see [our docs](../../docs/getting-started-inferencing.md)

## Cleanup

To remove the deployment:

```bash
# From examples/inference-scheduling
helmfile destroy -n ${NAMESPACE}

# Or uninstall manually
helm uninstall infra-inference-scheduling -n ${NAMESPACE}
helm uninstall gaie-inference-scheduling -n ${NAMESPACE}
helm uninstall ms-inference-scheduling -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

**_NOTE:_** If you set the `$RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX` environment variable, your release names will be different from the command above: `infra-$RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX`, `gaie-$RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX` and `ms-$RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX`.

### Cleanup HTTPRoute

Follow provider specific instructions for deleting HTTPRoute.

#### Cleanup for "kgateway" or "istio"

```bash
kubectl delete -f httproute.yaml -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

#### Cleanup for "gke"

```bash
kubectl delete -f httproute.gke.yaml -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

#### Cleanup for "digitalocean"

```bash
kubectl delete -f httproute.yaml -n ${NAMESPACE}
```
